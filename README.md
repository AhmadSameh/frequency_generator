# Frequency Generator
This project is based on the 8051 microcontroller, it takes input from a keypad for the frequency to be output and shows the selected frequency
on a quad 7 segment. <br>
This project was made on a PCB and simulated in proteus.

- The input value is 5000
- It can be seeen that the output period is 4.95 â€“ 24.75 = 0.2 ms.
- We can calculate the frequency from it by dividing by 1 by the period: Frequency = 1 / 0.2 ms = 5000 Hz. And the result is accurate for that value.
